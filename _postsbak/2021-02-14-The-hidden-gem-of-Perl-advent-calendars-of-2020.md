We had advent calendars once again this year :smiley:

There was the [Perl advent calendar 2020](http://perladvent.org/2020/) that was special this year since it was a "best of".

There was also the [Raku advent calendar](https://raku-advent.blog/) where I even contributed an article about [performances, profiling and optimizations](https://raku-advent.blog/2020/12/10/day-10-my-10-commandments-for-raku-performances/) :sunglasses:

And the [Twelve days of dancer](https://advent.perldancer.org/2020) :dancer:

I think there was no **Mojolicious** advent calendar this year (?!).

Except if I forgot one (please comment!) this is the list of Perl related advent calendars... But STOP! There was an hidden gem that traversed december while being relatively unnoticed.

[Paul "Leonerd" Evans](https://metacpan.org/author/PEVANS) delivered a complete [Perl advent calendar 2020](http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2020/12/2020-perl-advent-calendar-day-1.html) (alone! :astonished:)

To be honest, I discovered recently and haven't had time to read it, but I wanted to share the link :grin:

The advent calendar discusses asynchronous control flow which is a very interesting but complex topic. 

It's the second time he produced an advent calendar alone (see his [Perl advent calendar in 2013](http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2013/12/futures-advent-day-1.html)).

I recognize the effort when it personally takes me a lot of time to write blog posts, maybe because I'm not an English native speaker, but also because it simply just takes a lot ot times to write blog posts.

This guy clearly deserves a medal.

Without mentioning that [he is writing a core Perl feature blog serie](https://dev.to/mjgardner/paul-evans-writing-a-core-perl-feature-110e) and [he pushed de-experimentalising "signatures"](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18537) that was very well received.

And on top of that, he's a core Perl contributor.
