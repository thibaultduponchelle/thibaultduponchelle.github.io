I like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it provides a nice little and simple free hosting. I also like their [static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) (SSG) companions:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - used by example for [perl.com](https://perl.com) ([source](https://github.com/perladvent/perldotcom))
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - that I used for [The ephemeral miniconf](https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/) ([source](https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf))

About 3 years ago, I spent some time experimenting with more advanced Hugo and Jekyll concepts ([variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/), [config](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/), [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/), [includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/), ...). 

I wanted to produce a modular website with content separated from a complex structure, using parameterized includes. 

The experiment also contained a commenting system powered by GitHub issues (yes!) along with a blog (it’s Jekyll after all!). 
I used this effort to compare Hugo and Jekyll features (Jekyll won for me). 
Then I continued by adding some content, syntax highlighting and various other things...

But why I tagged this post with `#perl` tag? 

Because ultimately the website content is about Perl, with some generic informations and links that I tried to present in a bit "catchy" way.

After some time, I let this website aging somewhere in my GitHub private space. 

Nobody asked for it, but this is finally it! 

# :fish: [perl.fish](https://perl.fish/) :tropical_fish:

It’s public but I have zero plan for this. 

And about the name "perl-dot-fish", I doubt I can give any explanation except that I consider that "it sounds good".

# A little preview 

For the very most lazy :grinning:, here is a little preview:

It’s also looking good on mobile.

Note: for the design skeleton, I started from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (license permits it), but it now has well diverged.

## About the stack
- Registry: [Identity Digital](https://www.identity.digital/) for the `.fish` (I wanted to pick a not so common nTLD)
- Registrar: [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com)
- DNS: [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com)
- Hosting: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Framework: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (SSG)

I built using Jekyll [parameterized includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/), to me it makes it both modular and a bit inelegant :grinning: 
Website is easy to edit and the GitHub Pages setup [deploys on commit](https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/perlfish/actions).

It’s and experiment, probably running for about a year.
