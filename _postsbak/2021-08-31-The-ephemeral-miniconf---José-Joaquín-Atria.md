He was one of the early speakers to join [the ephemeral miniconf](https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/) \o/

## Bio
José Joaquín Atria own bio says: 
"A Speech Scientist in a previous life, I now work full time as a programmer, and appreciate the stable hours and not having to fund my own work. If you need a climbing buddy, hit me up!"

Or even "I write code for fun, and some times get paid to do it" :heart:

## Talk
I'm afraid to declare that I have yet no idea what José Joaquín will talk about :grinning:
