# Speaker announcement: Stephane Gigandet
If there is one giant Perl flagship that has almost no echo in Perl community... it is [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)

It's a project that has a social scope and an impact on society. But stop, I don't want to say one more word, I let this task to Stephane!

I discovered Stephane at TPRCiC where he delivered a [lightning talk](https://youtu.be/imugl2dSdnU).

Stephane is not only focused on Open Food Facts but he is the creator a several projects including blog hosting platforms or website for kids.
