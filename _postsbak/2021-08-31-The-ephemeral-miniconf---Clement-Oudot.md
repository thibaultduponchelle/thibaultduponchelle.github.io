# Speaker announcement: Clement Oudot
When I tried to find speakers for [the ephemeral miniconf](https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/), I contacted (or "bothered" or "spammed") some french people that I knew could give very interesting talks. And I'm very happy that it worked! 

[Clement Oudot](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/clementoudot) is a strong Open Source (or even "Open standard") believer, and as such he is part of the board of [CNLL](https://cnll.fr/) and [OW2](https://www.ow2.org/).

He is also an expert in LDAP and more in general directories, IAM, authentication etc... 

## Talk
Clement will present [LemonLDAP::NG](https://lemonldap-ng.org/welcome/) which you probably already know since it's a major implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
