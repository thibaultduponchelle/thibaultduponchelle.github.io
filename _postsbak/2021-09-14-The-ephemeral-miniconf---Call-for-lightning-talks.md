A bit more than one weeks ago, I announced [the tentative planning](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-tentative-planning-aom) for [the ephemeral miniconf](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-292j) that will take place the 18th of november 2021.

I'm very proud that all slots were filled very quickly and I'm also very happy with the speakers that I presented in dedicated blog posts:
- [Mark Gardner](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-speaker-presentation-i0e) 
- [Juan Julián Merelo](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-speaker-annoucement-4n8f) 
- [Stephane Gigandet](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-speaker-annoucement-314d) 
- [Clement Oudot](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-clement-oudot-2a1a) 
- [José Joaquín Atria](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-jose-joaquin-atria-2m5h) 
- [Adam Russell](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-adam-russell-3599)

(I also plan to speak but I did not write a post about myself :grinning:)

# Call to lightning talk speakers
If the *"normal"* slots are filled, I'm still looking for lightning talk speakers. 

Giving a lightning talk is very easy, it's short (less than 5 min and it don't have to be close to 5 min, it can be 1 min) and can be funny or an advertisement or presenting a module or a short technical presentation...

So come on guys, let's join the speakers side!
