## Blogging here or there
If in 2023 I did almost no blogging at all, in 2022 I produced a decent number of posts, but not all landed on DevTo! 

Late 2022, I helped to make the Perl Advent Calendar tradition to run once again :santa:

2022 be like:

Believe me, all articles in [Perl Advent Calendar](https://perladvent.org/2022/index.html) deserve a read. But let me share mine :grinning:
