# Speaker annoucement: Mark Gardner

I first followed with appetite his talk/posts about signatures then I enjoyed, as many of you (inside and outside Perl community), his regular (re)posts on [his devto](https://dev.to/mjgardner) (but his main blog is on [phoenixtrap](https://phoenixtrap.com/))

It sounded like an evidence that he would be a good candidate to talk at [the ephemeral miniconf](https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/)!

## Mark is what we really call a senior developer
His own biography says: 
*"Hi, Iâ€™m Mark Gardner, [...] I help professional Perl developers to engineer modern, disciplined applications in the cloud so they can become experts that write easy-to-maintain code with confidence, increase their relevance in the market and get the best positions, high salaries, and work on interesting projects."*

Mark is a long time programmer and Perl developer that gave much more attention to my eyes recently. 

I can add my own on top of this, I like the way he work deep (with alternatives, with implications etc...) the topics he addresses (see his work on signatures) and with several links! 

## The favorite blogger of your favorite blogger
We are lucky to have some great Perl bloggers and Mark is one of the leaders!

He is currently running a serie of blog posts that are even sometimes hitting the top "outside Perl bubble" to reuse a formula from him.

## Conclusion
See you soon for next announcement!

**Kind reminder**: Call for papers still open but only 1 or 2 normal slot(s) remaining! See [The ephemeral miniconf announcement/CFP](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-292j) for details.
