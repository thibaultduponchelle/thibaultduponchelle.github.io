The story of the Perl logo is complex.

The following resources explain well the topic, they not only cover but actually led to the resolution of the "issue":

1. [The complex topics of Perl logos]({{ site.url }}/The-complex-topic-of-Perl-logos) (2021)
2. [Open letter to Tim O'Reilly to free the Perl camel]({{ site.url }}/Open-Letter-To-Tim-O-Reilly-To-Free-The-Perl-Camel) (2023)
3. [Futher on Perl camel]( {{site.url }}/Further-on-Perl-camel) (2024)
4. [Announcing "A new Logo for Perl"](https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html) (2024)
5. [Habemus Perl logo]({{ site.url }}/Habemus-Perl-logo) (2025)
6. [Podcast about Perl Logo](https://underbar.cpan.io/) (2025)
7. [Perl logo resources]({{ site.url}}/Perl-logo-resources) (2025)

Most of the background is explained in 1.

The open letter in 2 is a call to action (but prefer [the hacker news post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36648949) instead).

In 3 I looked at trademark and copyright of the legacy camel.

The 4 is official announcement of the new established logo and 5 is my echo announcement afterwards.

In 6 I was invited with other protagonists to talk about Perl logo in a podcast.

The 7 just share few pictures with medium sizes.
