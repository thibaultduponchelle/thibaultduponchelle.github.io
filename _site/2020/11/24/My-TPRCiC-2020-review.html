<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Sometimes bad things bring us good opportunities.</p>

<p>This was the case this year with Covid and “The Perl Conference”. This major yearly Perl conference became available to remote people and therefore renamed <a href="https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/">“The Perl and Raku Conference In The Cloud”</a></p>

<p>The event was well announced and we were able to pay to support the organizational costs (what I have done), but it was even not mandatory (free broadcast on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yapcna">youtube</a>).</p>

<p>I was very excited by the planning, I remember having difficulties to <a href="https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/schedule/">choose between talks</a> !</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/16t9402t3zne0djyif1a.png" alt="Mamy" />
(/me trying to choose between an amazing and a wonderful talk topic)</p>

<h2 id="here-we-are">Here we are</h2>
<p>Then finally the day has come and I was able to join Perl folks with the password shared one or two days before.</p>

<p>I was waiting with decent expectation (to not say excitement) for the first talk.</p>

<p>It consisted in a word from organizers followed by a keynote from Perl pumpking “Sawyer X”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cfgubinbjw78th92eocs.jpeg" alt="Sawyer X" /></p>

<p>What could be best as an luxury “aperitif” :smile:</p>

<p>I was ready, well prepared, first TPC, attending first talk, let’s go.</p>

<p>It was during this talk that was <strong>announced Perl 7</strong> !!</p>

<p>OMG, I was immediatly like this :</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/698bnbc6v6ftrnjpxfr3.jpg" alt="Surprised" /></p>

<p>Everybody was very excited and happy all around, like me.</p>

<p>This was my first TPC and the first talk I attended, later on I wondered myself if it was a bit “my fault” :smile:</p>

<p>If I decide to attend another TPC, what will be announced ? That we discovered aliens ?</p>

<p>Later on reddit I noticed this fun comment from @perlancar :
<img src="/assets/images/kq0msv1hrk2yku1ik5l1.png" alt="perlancar" /></p>

<h2 id="other-talks-in-bulk">Other talks, in bulk</h2>
<p>As I said I followed all the slots during all the TPC days. Was a bit rushy because often talks ended just when next one started (but it could not overlap because of the same room).</p>

<p>I really loved some very technical talks like the ones from <strong>Graham Ollis</strong> on <strong>FFI</strong> and <strong>Wasm</strong> (but I’m interested in Perl “native” stuff like aliens and xs so that’s not a surprise :smile:)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rbhw8o6pfh12c4376r5i.png" alt="FFI Graham" /></p>

<p>I’m also very interested in the way Perl folks put such lot of efforts into quality (CPAN testers and perl5 smokers etc…) and I enjoyed the talk about quality from <strong>Jim Keenan</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/haalrp9sh4msqgopcuu2.png" alt="Golden Mic" /></p>

<p>Please note the golden mic !</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/x8qrr46av5vf7nvzfx7x.png" alt="THE golden Mic" /></p>

<p>There was a lightening talk on <a href="https://pullrequest.club/hello">Pull Request Club</a>, do you know this ? If not you should join !</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/g39udabfskcidzc2tfpp.png" alt="Alt Text" /></p>

<p>Multiple talks discussed about “Continuous Integration” topic that I follow for my day to day job, and it was very interesting. One of them was from <strong>Olaf Alders</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/387qol9p0vxbsd87tefc.png" alt="Alt Text" /></p>

<p>I was also very impressed by the lightning talk about <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org/">OpenQA</a> project.</p>

<p>One guy made a psychedelic talk about command line tools, I don’t understood what it does exactly but that was crazy.</p>

<p>I also joined several “BOF” to talk or ask questions about topics like <strong>Perl 7</strong> or <strong>TPF missions</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-damian-conway-show">The Damian Conway Show</h2>
<p>Later, there was the keynote from <strong>Damian Conway</strong>.</p>

<p>People said you should prepare for it and come with a beer and peanuts. That’s totally true.</p>

<p>Was not that simple to explain to my wife that I open a beer in front of my computer… at midnight (was that time France), but was definitely worth to do it :smile:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/21gqxw8z9k0caa4f5u3z.png" alt="Damian Harold" /></p>

<p>This talk completely turned my brain (like the psychedelic one that I discussed earlier) :smiley:</p>

<p>All people in the associated chat become totally crazy also and I laught a lot with fun and smart comments.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This TPC was my first Perl conference and it was a wonderful experience for me.</p>

<p>I wanted to thank all organizers like Todd Rinaldo and all others.</p>

<p>I also wanted to highlight Geoffrey Avery that was handling the BOF and/or lightning talks (don’t remember well).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/xbkbyz8ou263yvhs2zaz.png" alt="Geoffrey Avery" /></p>

<p>He said something poignant around the end of the TPC like : “dear newcomers, please don’t disappear”.</p>

<p>I had so much fun that I personally promised myself to join again as much Perl conferences as possible.</p>
