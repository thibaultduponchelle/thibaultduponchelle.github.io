<p>Adam is a Sr. Principal Engineer with Optum. His primary work is with Graph Databases and developing graph based applications and analytics, with a broader interest in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Previous uses of Perl include all the code for his PhD dissertation which was in the areas of Computational Geometry and Data Visualization.</p>

<p>Adam uses Perl extensively for algorithm development and rapid prototyping purposes in his current work. He also runs the <a href="https://discord.gg/vNXP2PkZ">Perl CS discord</a> (a server about Perl and algoritms :smiley:) and blogs frequently on his <a href="http://www.rabbitfarm.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/">personal blog</a> and also on <a href="https://adamcrussell.livejournal.com/">livejournal</a> (being often featured in <a href="https://perlweekly.com/a/adam-russell.html">PerlWeekly</a>!).</p>

<h2 id="talk">Talk</h2>
<p>Adam plans on speaking on developing game playing AIs using Perl. In particular, a generalized game playing framework he is working on to facilitate reproducible results in that area.</p>
