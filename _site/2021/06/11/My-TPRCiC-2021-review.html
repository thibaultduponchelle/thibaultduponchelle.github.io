    <p>Last year I wrote a <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-tprcic-2020-review-1187">(poignant?) review of TPRCiC</a> as one of my first blog posts.</p>

<p>Once again this year, I attended <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/">The Perl and Raku Conference in the Cloud</a> (and I even talked :scream: :speak_no_evil:), so here we go again for the review!</p>

<h2 id="fresh-starters">Fresh starters</h2>
<h3 id="elasticsearch-data-exploration-in-your-terminal">Elasticsearch Data Exploration in Your Terminal</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/reyjrar">Brad Lhotsky</a> came with a very <strong>solid</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/cexwpN3N2j0">talk</a>… :+1:</p>

<p>With a live demo (he’s mad). That worked! (he’s <del>lucky</del> good :grin:)</p>

<p>And the overall was very nice to listen (he’s maybe experimented at this exercise - EDIT: yes he is).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/1lfos8wi3z01nl4wqav9.png" alt="Brad" /></p>

<p>I enjoyed the topic (<a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/">ElasticSearch</a>), the comparisons and expertise about this technology and other related ones.</p>

<p>And… Yes… A working <em>live</em> demo… What else?</p>

<h3 id="openfoodfacts">OpenFoodFacts</h3>
<p><a href="https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/">OpenFoodFacts</a> well deserved his <a href="https://youtu.be/imugl2dSdnU">lightning talk</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stephanegigandet">Stephane Giganded</a> presented this project (does it really need to be introduced?) discussed about GSOC (or similar) and sent a call to volunteers!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/m3qhk2gr3zinrj7qc1hq.png" alt="Stephane" /></p>

<h2 id="main-dishes">Main dishes</h2>
<h3 id="perlimports">perlimports</h3>
<p>I love when programming languages are doing cross pollination. This was the beginning of the story about <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlimports/view/script/perlimports">perlimports</a> from <a href="https://www.olafalders.com/">Olaf Alders</a>.</p>

<p>His <a href="https://youtu.be/fKqxdTbGxYY">talk</a> was very comprehensive from basic importing concepts to the implementation problems through vim integration and various features of his <strong>must have</strong> new tool!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/lmsbs0yhrqcktgjagtw7.png" alt="Olaf" /></p>

<p>I think I prefered this talk over his last year talk… Sorry to the “<em>last-year-olaf</em>”:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/od7g3asdrzxe93s8svy1.jpeg" alt="Olaf" /></p>

<h3 id="whats-new">What’s new</h3>
<p>One of our pumpkings <a href="https://github.com/rjbs">rjbs</a> gave a very common (in programming languages conferences) <strong>“what’s new”</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/FlGpiS39NMY">talk</a>.</p>

<p>If you follow the status of Perl, you know it has been a difficult year for the language. I won’t go into details. I never talked about it on this blog so far (and will probably never do).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/l5mbgi22ht9op4ek54q1.png" alt="Rik" /></p>

<p>Rik highlighted this state of things very well and did it very transparently. I personally feel like he is very diplomatic and has a strong sense of duty.</p>

<p>The second part of the talk was about changelog, there is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try/catch</code> :tada: and various smaller things that are still cool when explained by Rik!</p>

<p>(everything is cool when explained by rik :heart: #fanboy)</p>

<h3 id="raku-syntax-i-miss-in-other-languages">Raku syntax I miss in other languages</h3>
<p>I also enjoyed very much this <a href="https://youtu.be/elalwvfmYgk">talk</a>. I know a little bit of Raku, and I have to admit that it’s clearly a super powerful language.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/k93l3k6hydmyn87p0yrn.png" alt="Leon" /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Leont">Leon Timmermans</a> delivered a very nice talk and he’s really good at spotlighting the features of <a href="https://www.raku.org/">Raku</a> like named arguments, zip operator, junction, smart match etc etc etc… (there is so much)</p>

<h3 id="local-setup-for-a-complex-app-using-docker-compose">Local setup for a complex app using docker-compose</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/ARpLPQWblAM">presentation</a> from <a href="https://github.com/domm">Thomas Klausner</a> is for me the perfect example of <strong>“Simple slides… Great presentation!”</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/61t9c8055hpewzzylbgq.png" alt="Domm" /></p>

<p>He described how he managed a multi-tier application with docker-compose (it’s more about service description than containerization) for reproducible local setup.</p>

<p>And he delivered his talk in a very <em>pleasant</em> way… Congrats :+1:</p>

<h2 id="dessert">Dessert</h2>
<p>I loved last year <strong>octology</strong> lightning talk and <a href="https://github.com/pip">pip</a> striked again!</p>

<p>This time with a 20min <a href="https://youtu.be/FgS6IXq-xVE">talk</a>. I have to admit I haven’t understood everything, it’s always a kind of mystic/psychedelic art… And that’s what I love.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/t2zmbzxm0m4sh8iecogn.png" alt="Pip" /></p>

<h2 id="im-not-hungry-anymore-but">I’m not hungry anymore but…</h2>

<h3 id="rummaging-in-the-clooset">Rummaging in the clOOset</h3>
<p>One of the most important talk of this conference is definitely the <a href="https://youtu.be/FO5ift28RyE">Rummaging in the clOOset</a> talk from <a href="https://ovid.github.io/">Curtis “Ovid” Poe</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vwby0ph9kzkae8h8b0w6.png" alt="Ovid" /></p>

<p>His talk discussed Object Oriented and Corinna (the incoming core Object Oriented implementation). Taking example from other languages and from important leaders then going more into details.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/7rdramy3zyn5vbnu9ver.png" alt="Mixins" /></p>

<p>Sadly the beginning of the talk was a bit choppy but it does not ruined anything!</p>

<p>The connection issues were even the subject to funny comments:
<img src="/assets/images/69f6vt5fhxpi9g7bglg1.png" alt="Brexit" /></p>

<p>Or even :joy:
<img src="/assets/images/q6m7skcsl0dgjm3hzh5e.png" alt="Baguette" /></p>

<h3 id="even-you-can-release-perl">Even you can release Perl</h3>
<p>A very nice <a href="https://youtu.be/LaNZu1aBEzE">talk</a> from <a href="https://github.com/Corion">Max Maischein</a> around release management, pumpking and perl packaging… From the inside!</p>

<p>With the real manual administrative details :+1:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ej14v4y31sxd9omeqwme.png" alt="Max" /></p>

<p>Very interesting :smile:</p>

<h3 id="perls-amazing-time-machine">Perl’s Amazing Time Machine</h3>
<p>And finally the <a href="https://youtu.be/Kc_bP73xNyM">talk</a> from <a href="http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/">Paul Evans</a> :tada:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/joz73lgtbte8a1ji9q4m.png" alt="Paul" /></p>

<p>AMAZING!</p>

<p>Always very smart and technical!</p>

<p>I feel smarter when I listen to his presentations :grin:</p>

<h3 id="cross-platform-native-guis-tradepayoffs-integradistribution">Cross-platform native GUIs: {trade,pay}offs, {integra,distribu}tion</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zmughal">Zaki Mughal</a> delivered a comprehensive and fun (even a song) <a href="https://youtu.be/En49kYRDbsg">talk</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/4f9z575mowzca7v8kvrm.png" alt="Zaki" /></p>

<p>The topic was GUI, human interactions, how to build…In a multiplatforms way… A lot of things actually! :grin:</p>

<p>Ok I’m <em>biaised</em> since <strong>sivoais</strong> (his nickname) is also a kind of “buddy” of mine :grin:</p>

<h2 id="folklore">Folklore</h2>
<h3 id="cut-by-the-gong">Cut by the gong</h3>
<p>Leonerd gave a talk about errors to avoid when doing a slide deck. While it was very interesting, it was kind of ironic that his slide about managing time was cut by the gong! (meaning the end of 5 minutes lightning talk)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/imvao0y21lux0tfwyfu9.png" alt="Gong" /></p>

<p>At the beginning I thought it was prepared :grin:</p>

<p>And for the record, the master of the gong:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/zsfac5wwps4rk6fkkmji.png" alt="Master of the gong" /></p>

<h3 id="esperanto">Esperanto</h3>
<h4 id="how-to-pronounce-perl-openfoodfact">How to pronounce Perl (OpenFoodFact)</h4>
<p>French people (including me) tends to say “pairl” for Perl when American (or just all others :smile:) say more something like “Purl”. But it is far from “Paul” which would more pronounce like “Pol” :grinning:</p>

<h4 id="the-back-slash-affair-exploring-text-based-protocols">The <strong>back</strong> slash affair (Exploring Text-Based Protocols)</h4>
<p>Could we decide once for all? :grin:</p>

<p>south-west to north-east / is “slash”
north-west to south-east \ is “<strong>back</strong> slash”</p>

<p>Anyway the <a href="https://youtu.be/8fjYawHyNZY">talk</a> from <a href="http://jberger.github.io/">Joel Berger</a> was very interesting :+1:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Once again, I enjoyed so much these 3 great days of conference!
I’m very proud for having joined the speaker side :muscle: (have you seen?)</p>

<p>Kudos/Hugs/:+1:/:muscle: to organizers and sponsors.</p>

<p>EDIT: I realized that I shared almost all but my talks (because hey I’m not mad enough to review my own talks :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:), but maybe you would be interested in watching them, so here are the links:</p>
