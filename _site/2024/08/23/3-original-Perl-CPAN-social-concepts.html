<p>I often mentally represent modules “per namespace” (I explained it <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/browse-cpan-modules-per-namespaces-6p">here</a>) like in a tree where we have a node “JSON” that contains all JSON related (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON:PP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON:XS</code>, etc…).</p>

<p>I know it’s partially wrong, there’s no such “order” and for instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cpanel::JSON::XS</code> is out of this hierarchy but still well a JSON thing. But most of the time, this mental model works.</p>

<p>If we care about the quality of the ecosystem, we should try to find a solution to <em>fight the CPAN inertia</em>.</p>

<p>Some important modules can be considered a bit a “common good” (is it wrong to think like this?) but we need also to respect the ownership and copyright.</p>

<p>So here is the concept of CPAN Lieutenants.</p>

<p>For some very specific cases (e.g. a module does not install at all), I think we should be able to “force apply” a patch to a module. 
Boundaries should be clear:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Purpose is to fix a broken module</li>
  <li>Fix is relatively simple (to review), blocker is about releasing it</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, it would mean to let few trusted members to manage a dedicated <strong>sub-tree</strong> of CPAN namespaces. And in extreme case, after some formal review, discussion and notifications, these people would be able to <strong>push</strong> a fix to CPAN (= publish a new release).</p>

<p>It would be a bit like these people, thanks to their trust and expertise, have implicit co-maintainer rights (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CO-MAINT</code> in CPAN jargon) on a topic (e.g. “Alien” modules, or “XML”).</p>

<p>It won’t imply these “lieutenants” to maintain these modules neither the ceremonial of asking (and eventually being refused) co-maintainer permissions. And don’t hear what I did not say: I do not criticize PAUSE operating model for that.</p>

<p>The name is inspired from Linux kernel development with “lieutenants” that have responsibility on sub parts of the kernel.</p>

<p>Also we need to respect authors and their rights. It’s a matter of finding the right balance so everybody wins. That’s why we should be careful with boundaries and rules (e.g. a minimum number of lieutenants approvals), the same way PAUSE admins are careful with module ownership.</p>

<p>If it proves to be incompatible with license, we could consider a layer of patches, inspired by what do several Linux distributions (see for instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Locally applied patches:</code> section under Debian/Ubuntu <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perl -V</code>).</p>

<p>It proved to work (for inertia and licensing) but I would prefer to avoid this, first because it’s generally considered good practice “to push patch upstream” when possible, also because it would add complexity and “yet another layer of patches”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CPAN release contains base delivery</li>
  <li>GitHub locally applied patches (merged commits in GitHub that never reached CPAN)</li>
  <li>CPAN locally applied patches :warning:</li>
  <li>OS Distribution locally applied patches</li>
</ul>

<p>But on the other hand, the CPAN local patch layer approach has advantage of managing the storage of patch (since <em>inertia</em> very likely also concerns code forge…)</p>

<p>I don’t know the exact solution, but I think there’s something to do :smile:</p>

<p>Actually, a recent discussion on <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2024/08/msg268685.html">perl development mailing list</a> (“p5p”) has highlighted the same need and discussed some close proposals. I swear I did not copied! :grinning: But it decided me to post this!</p>

<p><strong>edit 1</strong>: a CPAN module security vulnerability is also a valid reason to want this and I see that CPANSec folks have similar concern, see <a href="https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/11/views/1">CPAN Security Patch Tooling</a></p>

<p><strong>edit 2</strong>: <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy#A-Social-Contract-about-Artistic-Control">A Social Contract about Artistic Control</a> - perl core statement (applies to modules added to perl core distribution)</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-difficult-road-to-perl-3o5f">the barrier of entry of Perl is high</a> but with a compatible mindset, once someone get in, Perl (and CPAN) produces often long time involved members.</p>

<p>These days, there’s no so much new entrants to the CPAN.</p>

<p>We should optimize for retention (and unity).</p>

<p>The idea of CPAN Mentors is to offer help to newcomers, once they pass the entry door, something that we can monitor from <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/">perl modules mailing list</a></p>

<p>Let’s say after 3 weeks, if a new CPAN AUTHOR has not published any module, someone can drop a little mail:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hello new CPAN AUTHOR,

I noticed you recently registered to PAUSE/CPAN, congratulation for this.
I also noticed that you did not publish any module, yet.
I don't know your level of expertise,
maybe you would benefit from some guidance?
I'm reaching you to kindly offer my help :) 
Feel free to ask me questions or we can maybe even accommodate some pairing via a call.

Regards.

Tib
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I think the number of new monthly CPAN registrations would permit it, and reinforce the community feeling that always been a strength of Perl.</p>

<h2 id="cpan-guards">CPAN Guards</h2>

<p>This concept joins actually a bit the CPAN Lieutenants concept.</p>

<p>The idea is to watch (and contribute to) a limited set of critical modules (depended by several modules or in Perl jargon: those high in the <a href="http://neilb.org/2015/12/22/cpan-river-water-quality.html">CPAN river</a>) and help keeping  them in good quality and portable.</p>

<p>This is actually not a new concept (forgive me the “original” in title), some people (CPANTesters and perl core developers) are already on it (see for instance <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa/2017/03/msg13747.html">BBC and CPAN River 5000</a>).</p>

<p>So it’s more about formalizing this under a fancy name.</p>

<p>CPAN Guards concept fits well the Perl folks that are more contributors than maintainers and prefer to jump often from modules to modules.</p>

<p>At some point it’s also related to the <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/2005/01/13/phalanx.html/">Perl Phalanx initiative</a> (more focused on tests)</p>
