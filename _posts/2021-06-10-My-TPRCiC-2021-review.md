title: My TPRCiC 2021 review
date: 2021-06-10 22:02:34

Last year I wrote a [(poignant?) review of TPRCiC](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-tprcic-2020-review-1187) as one of my first blog posts.

Once again this year, I attended [The Perl and Raku Conference in the Cloud](https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/) (and I even talked :scream: :speak_no_evil:), so here we go again for the review!

## Fresh starters
### Elasticsearch Data Exploration in Your Terminal 
[Brad Lhotsky](https://github.com/reyjrar) came with a very **solid** [talk](https://youtu.be/cexwpN3N2j0)... :+1:

With a live demo (he's mad). That worked! (he's ~~lucky~~ good :grin:) 

And the overall was very nice to listen (he's maybe experimented at this exercise - EDIT: yes he is).

I enjoyed the topic ([ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)), the comparisons and expertise about this technology and other related ones.

And... Yes... A working *live* demo... What else?

### OpenFoodFacts
[OpenFoodFacts](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/) well deserved his [lightning talk](https://youtu.be/imugl2dSdnU). 

[Stephane Giganded](https://github.com/stephanegigandet) presented this project (does it really need to be introduced?) discussed about GSOC (or similar) and sent a call to volunteers!

## Main dishes
### perlimports
I love when programming languages are doing cross pollination. This was the beginning of the story about [perlimports](https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlimports/view/script/perlimports) from [Olaf Alders](https://www.olafalders.com/).

His [talk](https://youtu.be/fKqxdTbGxYY) was very comprehensive from basic importing concepts to the implementation problems through vim integration and various features of his **must have** new tool!

![Olaf](/assets/images/lmsbs0yhrqcktgjagtw7.png)

I think I prefered this talk over his last year talk... Sorry to the "*last-year-olaf*":

### What's new
One of our pumpkings [rjbs](https://github.com/rjbs) gave a very common (in programming languages conferences) **"what's new"** [talk](https://youtu.be/FlGpiS39NMY).

If you follow the status of Perl, you know it has been a difficult year for the language. I won't go into details. I never talked about it on this blog so far (and will probably never do). 

![Rik](/assets/images/l5mbgi22ht9op4ek54q1.png)

Rik highlighted this state of things very well and did it very transparently. I personally feel like he is very diplomatic and has a strong sense of duty.

The second part of the talk was about changelog, there is `try/catch` :tada: and various smaller things that are still cool when explained by Rik!

(everything is cool when explained by rik :heart: #fanboy)

### Raku syntax I miss in other languages
I also enjoyed very much this [talk](https://youtu.be/elalwvfmYgk). I know a little bit of Raku, and I have to admit that it's clearly a super powerful language.

![Leon](/assets/images/k93l3k6hydmyn87p0yrn.png)

[Leon Timmermans](https://github.com/Leont) delivered a very nice talk and he's really good at spotlighting the features of [Raku](https://www.raku.org/) like named arguments, zip operator, junction, smart match etc etc etc... (there is so much)

### Local setup for a complex app using docker-compose 
The [presentation](https://youtu.be/ARpLPQWblAM) from [Thomas Klausner](https://github.com/domm) is for me the perfect example of **"Simple slides... Great presentation!"**

![Domm](/assets/images/61t9c8055hpewzzylbgq.png)

He described how he managed a multi-tier application with docker-compose (it's more about service description than containerization) for reproducible local setup.

And he delivered his talk in a very *pleasant* way... Congrats :+1:

## Dessert
I loved last year **octology** lightning talk and [pip](https://github.com/pip) striked again!

This time with a 20min [talk](https://youtu.be/FgS6IXq-xVE). I have to admit I haven't understood everything, it's always a kind of mystic/psychedelic art... And that's what I love.

![Pip](/assets/images/t2zmbzxm0m4sh8iecogn.png)

## I'm not hungry anymore but...

### Rummaging in the clOOset
One of the most important talk of this conference is definitely the [Rummaging in the clOOset](https://youtu.be/FO5ift28RyE) talk from [Curtis "Ovid" Poe](https://ovid.github.io/)

![Ovid](/assets/images/vwby0ph9kzkae8h8b0w6.png)

His talk discussed Object Oriented and Corinna (the incoming core Object Oriented implementation). Taking example from other languages and from important leaders then going more into details.

![Mixins](/assets/images/7rdramy3zyn5vbnu9ver.png)

Sadly the beginning of the talk was a bit choppy but it does not ruined anything!

The connection issues were even the subject to funny comments:

Or even :joy:
![Baguette](/assets/images/q6m7skcsl0dgjm3hzh5e.png)

### Even you can release Perl
A very nice [talk](https://youtu.be/LaNZu1aBEzE) from [Max Maischein](https://github.com/Corion) around release management, pumpking and perl packaging... From the inside! 

With the real manual administrative details :+1:

![Max](/assets/images/ej14v4y31sxd9omeqwme.png)

Very interesting :smile:

### Perl's Amazing Time Machine
And finally the [talk](https://youtu.be/Kc_bP73xNyM) from [Paul Evans](http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/) :tada:

![Paul](/assets/images/joz73lgtbte8a1ji9q4m.png)

AMAZING!

Always very smart and technical!

I feel smarter when I listen to his presentations :grin:

### Cross-platform native GUIs: {trade,pay}offs, {integra,distribu}tion

[Zaki Mughal](https://github.com/zmughal) delivered a comprehensive and fun (even a song) [talk](https://youtu.be/En49kYRDbsg)!

![Zaki](/assets/images/4f9z575mowzca7v8kvrm.png)

The topic was GUI, human interactions, how to build...In a multiplatforms way... A lot of things actually! :grin:

Ok I'm *biaised* since **sivoais** (his nickname) is also a kind of "buddy" of mine :grin:

## Folklore
### Cut by the gong
Leonerd gave a talk about errors to avoid when doing a slide deck. While it was very interesting, it was kind of ironic that his slide about managing time was cut by the gong! (meaning the end of 5 minutes lightning talk)

![Gong](/assets/images/imvao0y21lux0tfwyfu9.png)

At the beginning I thought it was prepared :grin:

And for the record, the master of the gong:

### Esperanto 
#### How to pronounce Perl (OpenFoodFact)
French people (including me) tends to say "pairl" for Perl when American (or just all others :smile:) say more something like "Purl". But it is far from "Paul" which would more pronounce like "Pol" :grinning:

#### The **back** slash affair (Exploring Text-Based Protocols)
Could we decide once for all? :grin: 

south-west to north-east / is "slash"
north-west to south-east \ is "**back** slash"

Anyway the [talk](https://youtu.be/8fjYawHyNZY) from [Joel Berger](http://jberger.github.io/) was very interesting :+1:

## Conclusion
Once again, I enjoyed so much these 3 great days of conference!
I'm very proud for having joined the speaker side :muscle: (have you seen?)

Kudos/Hugs/:+1:/:muscle: to organizers and sponsors.

EDIT: I realized that I shared almost all but my talks (because hey I'm not mad enough to review my own talks :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:), but maybe you would be interested in watching them, so here are the links:
