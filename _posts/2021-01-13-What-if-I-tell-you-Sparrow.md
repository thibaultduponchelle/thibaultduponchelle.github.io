title: What if I tell you "Sparrow"?

When I read **Sparrow** I think about:

Or:

Or even:

But I'm pretty sure that [his author](https://github.com/melezhik) sees this:

![Sparrow](/assets/images/btwr1970ogcitpon32zl.jpeg)

(because it is actually what means "sparrow")

Alternatively, I think about the well known contemporary pirate:

But to be honest, my favorite stays the **pirate dog** !

## What exactly is Sparrow ?

[Sparrow](https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6) is an automation framework. And to be more specific, it is "agentless" and comes with a [hub](https://sparrowhub.io) with hundreds of ready to use tasks.

Tasks can be written in various programming languages because of the flexibility of [Sparrow](https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6).

If we talk about scenario file (the "recipe", think playbook/Jenkinsfile/workflow), [Sparrow](https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6) accepts an handy DSL but has aswell real programming capabilities (= you can mix code).

Overall, think *"ansible"* but without yaml (bye bye `loop` and `with_<lookup>`).

## What next ?
Today, the [Sparrow](https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6) ecosystem is mature enough ([Sparrow](https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6) and [Sparrowhub](https://sparrowhub.io/)) but is still in active development, including [Sparky](https://github.com/melezhik/sparky), a lightweight CI server/UI built on top of it that is in early development.

If you want to support, you can join the effort with code or simply just drop a star or a comment on one of projects linked previously.
