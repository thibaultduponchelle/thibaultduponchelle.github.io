We find plenty of jokes against Perl, all around the web. It's often trendy to denigrate Perl. 

Check out for instance [the hate for Perl is real](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/cudgs7/the_hate_for_perl_is_real/)

It makes me laugh so I gathered some "Perl internet memes" below :smile:

EDIT: I just noticed this [buddy post](https://blog.builtinperl.com/post/perl-memes-all-around), I share you the link ! :smiley:

## Pure hate
The people behind these memes seems really hating Perl:

![WTF](/assets/images/8rn2xeu85jfvbg2eqax6.jpeg)

Really, using Perl deserves to receive a giant slap!

![Batman](/assets/images/laohx6r9su34vtfzqwag.jpg)

Or the only problem with Perl is Perl (or something like this):

![Dont use](/assets/images/v3b59tfh0iaktb8ascy6.jpg)

Or outdated:

![1995 Perl](/assets/images/4egzzetabofmpe8m14a3.png)

Or muddy:

## Funny
### Perl is difficult
Only "baby-perl" is for newcomers, "Perl" is for real men:

![Bad time](/assets/images/won6u1n1izocm54zkug7.jpg)

Fun about syntax :

Having 2 problems is better than having only 1 problem : 

![2 Problems](/assets/images/g5tbg8f0r1dnxfmjcqw8.jpeg)

### Perl is crazy
A very famous meme is about [paint splatters validity as a Perl code](https://www.famicol.in/sigbovik/) (ultra flexybility of Perl sparser):

![Valid splatters](/assets/images/6y2g60a3ktgss8xqape5.png)

Or a meme based on [infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem):

![Random monkeys typing Perl](/assets/images/juar3c8msarwxiyi169o.jpg)

And there is a derived sentence similar:
> Given enough time, a monkey typing at random would, as part of its output, almost surely produce one of Shakespeare's plays. All other outputs are Perl programs.

Perl is also seen as cursed ! (note the number of votes)

![Demon](/assets/images/wpgin3xzqkeun5c46npg.png)

Or even it invokes **Cthulhu**:

![Demon again](/assets/images/k7b6ch8wyaje2rmq4uto.jpeg)

### Perl is unreadable 
If it is written on a cover of a book, it's obviously true :

![Oh Really](/assets/images/7013n352wy60pzpzs3hx.jpg)

It's a mental disorder (I confirm!) :

![Blah](/assets/images/bqz71hy5dxbmnmwbqgeh.jpg)

Get the job done but at what cost ? 

![Shellcode](/assets/images/ogwoudhlo2zw718axzmm.jpg)

Or Perl is only symbols:

![Perl punctuation](/assets/images/bj2l55r03rxtrtu7hgt3.jpg)

Please keep our little secret :speak_no_evil:

## My contribution
I added mine, for posterity :

![Headache](/assets/images/0t9n3lbf9wcyawsqd1z7.jpg)

With [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in Jan 2026 saying " Perl made a surprising comeback, jumping from position #32 to #11 and re-entering the top 20", I got the idea to create this new meme:

## Still use
And finally, don't hear other people and do what you want :smile:
