## Updated schedule
This is an updated version of the schedule:
![The ephemeral miniconf planning](/assets/images/0waoeoxmy7zyfw8oa2dm.png)

Hours can vary a bit (if a speaker needs to adjust or if I need) but overall planning will look like this (3~4 hours of presentations).

The planning is given in **UTC+1** and you can [check your local time on this page](https://everytimezone.com/s/ec3d1b5c) 

## No more lightning talks
Please note that **lightning talks** are no longer a thing so... You can now safely ignore my [Call for lightning talks](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-call-for-lightning-talks-36h9) from last week :grinning:

## How to attend
Please note that **the ephemeral miniconf** will be in *less than 2 months from now*!

Remember the event will be **free** and **online**.
