For a recent post, I needed a CPAN logo, so I jumped to [cpan.org](cpan.org) to find one, but the quality was very disappointing :cry:

And if you look at it in gimp:

Then I put in my mind to try to do one by myself (I'm almost a total noob at inkscape).

This weekend, after *hours* (yes believe me) of trials (`potrace`, vectorizer.io, vectormagic.com, `autotrace`, `imagemagick`, `inkscape`...) I got something nice, here is my preview :dancer::

This is a png because devto does not accept to embed SVG but do not use this one but [CPAN logo SVG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thibaultduponchelle/action-upload-to-cpan/master/cpan.svg)

What about licence of logo? I don't know, I found no info on [disclaimer page](https://www.cpan.org/disclaimer.html). If there is any problem, please shout and I remove it immediately (I will send a mail to cpan@perl.org to clarify)

EDIT: It is Artistic License or GPLv1+
