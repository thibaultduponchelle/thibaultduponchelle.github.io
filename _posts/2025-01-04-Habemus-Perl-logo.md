## The new Perl logo
Perl has a logo!

![Perl new logo - camels](/assets/images/ixx9e4uy0cnyhiizofwo.png)

I mean, a **FREE** logo.

It's a camel, with good quality and not a derivative of O'Reilly camel...

Take your time to fall in love with it.  

Use it... or not, no obligation.

But we have one, a free one, that we can use.
