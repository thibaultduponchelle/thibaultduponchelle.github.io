I continue my reviews with another antic Perl book :smile:

## Disclaimer
A lot of weaknesses of this book are due to the age but I won't refrain to report them with honesty :)

I'm very grateful to the person that took time to write this book : **Mark Riehl** and **Ilya Sterin** !

## The bad
It is outdated, definitely, like a bit frozen in 2003.

I wrote another book review about [Perl and LWP](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/book-review-perl-and-lwp-emd) which was outdated also but not suffering as much as this book.

Clearly, this book was written during the "XML boom" in 2003 and keeps scars from this period :
* The coding style is not modern 
* When you want to make people able to be quickly efficient with Perl and XML (probably the idea of the authors), you give a lot of "ready to use" code snippets (and it ages bad)

When I looked for some technologies in Google, I was suprised (but interested) to see they were just dead :grin: :
* Axkit 
* XQL

There is only one edition of this book therefore it explains why it is so outdated.

## The good 
I liked the way it goes deep in the XML things like `xslt`, `XML schema`, `xlink` and `xpointer`.

I really appreciated to explanations about `Web Services` (very clear, **best explanation I read about this topic so far !**) `SOAP` and `XML-RPC`.

In the same topic, the comparison `SOAP` vs `CORBA` vs `RMI` vs ... is very nicely detailed.

In the part about XML in general, I found some very interesting parts :
* Listing and details about elements
* When to use attributes or elements (this endless question has a simple answer...)
* `DTD` vs `XML Schema`

And finally the paragraphs about **tying XML to RDBMS** are very interesting.

What is `Schematron` and `WML` ? :grin:

## Conclusion 
To really enjoy this book, you need to know Perl but you should not know too much XML (which was not my case, I already studied the XML spec in the past to write an [XML minifier](https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Minifier))

There are **TOO MUCH** code samples, each time the XML sample + the DTD + Perl code to process it = TOO MUCH :smiley:

No human can read so much code samples without falling asleep :sleeping:

But overall there's still a lot of history bits and various notions around XML and the book really deserves to be skimmed.
