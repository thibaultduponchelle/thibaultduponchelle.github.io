Fonda Lee [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FondaJLee/status/1221647630368854019) something like this about books marketing : 

    "In the long run, the thing that sells books the most 
    is word of mouth. 

    This goes 10x for books that aren’t launched with big marketing 
    or publicity support i.e. 95% of books. 

    What I’m saying is, talk up the books you love, 
    because their survival depends on it."

That's why I started a serie of Perl books review :smiley:
(and also for personal notetaking :+1:)
