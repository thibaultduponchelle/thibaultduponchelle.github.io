<p>Along the year I some took notes about Perl events/news and it’s time to drop my retrospective!</p>

<h1 id="perl-governance">Perl governance</h1>
<p>This year saw several changes around the Perl core governance with the setup of <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/wiki/Perl-Steering-Council">Perl steering committee</a> and <a href="https://github.com/toddr/RFB/blob/master/0001-rfb-process.md">Perl Proposal for Enhancement</a> (I think it since changed its name to RFCs). We now have people opening RFCs e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17949">RFC 004</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlgov">perlgov policy</a> have seen several changes, perl 5 maintainers are now using <a href="https://perl.topicbox.com/latest">Perl topicbox space</a> for administrative discussions (e.g. voting) while <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/">p5p</a> still remains for technical discussions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/xsawyerx">SawyerX</a> resigned and we now have 3 Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhist#PUMPKIN?">pumpkins</a> instead only one.</p>

<h1 id="perl-core">Perl core</h1>
<p>Apple decided to enable -Werror producing trouble in Perl 5 core, a grant for <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_documentation_standards_perl7">documentations improvements</a> was accepted (in addition to the usual core maintenance grants) and… The original Perl 7 idea died.</p>

<p>The feature “signature” was proposed to become <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18537">no longer experimental</a>, a new (experimental) <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlexperiment#isa-infix-operator">isa keyword</a> appeared and Cor changed its name to <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor">Corinna</a>!</p>

<p>The perl5 repository gets <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5">1000 stars</a>:</p>

<p>Concerning releasing flow, the development versions of Perl restarted after some months of pause (at least to test non-regressions on the CPAN river).</p>

<h1 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h1>
<p>There were serious discussions about maintainer-ship and the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2020/08/msg00006.html">status of libemperl in Debian</a>. The same kind of adventure happened to <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/03/msg259344.html">mod_perl being candidate to go “attic”</a> (going attic means being archived, and we usually never returns from this place).</p>

<p>Kritika.io also closed this year :/</p>

<h1 id="toolchain">Toolchain</h1>
<p><a href="http://neilb.org/index.html">Neil Bowers</a> (one of our current Pumpkins) spent time to <a href="https://neilb.org/2020/08/08/cpan-spelunking.html">resolve inconsistent permissions</a> while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/hzjqcy/malicious_code_in_moduleautoload/">malicious code was found in module AutoLoad</a>.</p>

<p>The CPAN mirror list was <a href="https://log.perl.org/2021/02/cpan-mirror-list-changes.html">finally abandoned</a> since fastly CDN is doing the same job.</p>

<p>@davorg came with <a href="https://cpandashboard.com/">CPAN Dashboards</a>.</p>

<p>The “Bus factor river” was <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2021/06/cpan-bus-factor.html">added to MetaCPAN</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/k8d3s6p1wft85hgd6tg5.png" alt="Bus factor" /></p>

<h1 id="community">Community</h1>
<p>People doing <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/">Weekly Challenge</a> started to post live coding  sessions!</p>

<p>Once again this year the major Perl conference <a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/">TPRCiC</a> was online (and a success… and I gave talks \o/)</p>

<p>Perl (and Raku) also had their own room at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/perl_and_raku_programming/">FOSDEM 2021</a>.</p>

<p>The must-have space game <a href="https://taustation.space/">Tau Station</a> has launched (by mistake for the record) its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1246097605/tau-station-the-mmo-biblio-rpg?lang=fr">kickstarter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cszavkkapx5dgi59zy0s.jpg" alt="Tau" /></p>

<p>The ticket tracker <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/">rt.cpan.org</a> was <a href="https://log.perl.org/2020/12/rtcpanorg-sunset.html">announced as closing</a> then finally the maintenance handed over and <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/rt-cpan-org-upgraded">rt.cpan.org moved to new home</a> (with an upgrade). Despite github issue tracker being often preferred, Request Tracker is a very good issue tracker and offers an independent issue tracker (what if github suddenly decided to change its policy towards open source?)</p>

<p>Another event that happened and had some echo outside or Perl community was when <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/the-hijacking-of-perl-com/">Perl.com was kind of “hacked”</a>.</p>

<p>Once again this year we had <a href="https://perladvent.org/2020/">Perl advent calendar</a> and even the <a href="http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2020/12/2020-perl-advent-calendar-day-1.html">Leonerd advent calendar</a>.</p>

<p>And… The <a href="https://dev.to/t/perl">#perl on devto</a> started to work well :grinning:</p>

<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rexify.org/">Rex friendly automation framework</a> celebrated its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/iict7r/celebrating_4000_commits_of_rex_o/">4000th commit</a> and its <a href="https://www.rexify.org/docs/release_notes/1.13.1.html">10 years</a> :tada:</p>

<p>Do you know <a href="https://smxi.org/docs/inxi.htm">inxi</a> ?</p>

<h1 id="raku">Raku</h1>
<p>Raku community discussed about having its own foundation and organized its first <a href="https://conf.raku.org/">dedicated conference</a>!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That was a complicated year, Perl is changing, moving forwards but not without trouble.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this retrospective!</p>
