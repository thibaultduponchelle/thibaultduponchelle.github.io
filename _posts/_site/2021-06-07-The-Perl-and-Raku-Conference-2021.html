<p>It’s once again this time of the year! :smile:</p>

<p><a href="https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/">The Perl and Raku Conference (in the Cloud)</a> is back!</p>

<p>It’s happening tomorrow and you will be able to follow the talks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yapcna">YouTube</a> but if you really want to join the fest, you have to pay <a href="https://tprc2021cic.sched.com/tickets?iframe=no">a small fee of 10$</a> to receive the precious password to join the conference (I recommend to to this).</p>

<p>You will then be able to join thanks to <a href="https://zoom.us/download">zoom</a></p>

<h2 id="last-year">Last year</h2>
<p>Last year I enjoyed a lot the conference and wrote <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-tprcic-2020-review-1187">this review</a>, read it if you haven’t already :grinning:</p>

<p>For the record, last year was announced <strong>Perl 7</strong> :tada:</p>

<h2 id="my-talks">My talks</h2>
<p>This year, I took a step to become a speaker :sunglasses:</p>

<p>I prepared 2 talks, first one will be a lightning talk that I called <a href="https://tprc2021cic.sched.com/event/jM3n/lightning-talks-day-1?iframe=no"><strong>“My big year of GitHub actions”</strong></a>: I made so much GitHub workflows this year that I know a bit the limits (I used and abused a bit from this service). I came to know even some corner cases (or was pushed a little bit into them). I will tell you them, chronologically.</p>

<p>My second talk is called <a href="https://tprc2021cic.sched.com/event/jqLE/answering-questions-about-cpan-that-nobody-asked?iframe=no"><strong>“Answering questions about CPAN that nobody asked”</strong></a> and is about experiments around package managers, CPAN/PAUSE, EUMM/MB, dependencies and versioning. I will guide you through my tests and I assure it will be entertaining and lightweight :+1:
This one is longer and will also discuss a bit “general engineering practices” (applied to Perl ecosystem).</p>

<p>See you there (maybe?) :smiley:</p>
