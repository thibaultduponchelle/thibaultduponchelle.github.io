<p>I stayed a bit quiet these past days about <strong>The ephemeral miniconf</strong> but you can’t imagine how much seriously I’m preparing the event.</p>

<p>For those who are not aware, <strong>The ephemeral miniconf</strong> is a Perl and Raku free and online miniconf!</p>

<p>I’m taking it cool but I’m not this kind of guy to take it cool :grinning:</p>

<p>I’m this kind of guy to <em>meticulously</em> repeat and try so I get no surprise (at least I try to reduce the chances it happens to the maximum).</p>

<p>I will not give too much details now, since I could do a nice “making of” blog post, maybe after the event (?!) who knows :grinning:</p>

<p>Everything is going well, you should really book your calendar for Thursday 18th of November (next week).</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/ec3d1b5c">the timezone planner</a> or see this picture:</p>

<p>It’s in the morning if you’re in US, in the afternoon if you’re in Europe and very late if you’re in Asia (sorry).</p>

<p>The planning is still the same except that some talks have changed their title:
<img src="/assets/images/ai4k0wk1swcgobuq27uj.png" alt="The ephemeral miniconf" /></p>

<p>(it could change a bit inside the range, like shifting talks, but at the moment here it is)</p>

<p>I’m also preparing some surprises that I don’t want to reveal for now.</p>

<p>So my message is basically, it’s coming, book your calendar and I’m looking forward to see you at <strong>The ephemeral miniconf</strong>! :+1:</p>
