<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>Perl has its own platform for blogging with Perl specifics posts only. It is maybe a particularity of Perl community, even if I’m not sure about that.</p>

<p>From what I know, between 2001 and 2010, Perl developers were initially blogging on <a href="https://use-perl.github.io/">use.perl.org</a> that was decommissioned in 2010.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bi4x42r6jth3jynfsy38.png" alt="use.perl.org" /></p>

<p>Then they moved (partially) to <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> or as some people call it “BPO”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/1w6qc7veih2083muj74m.png" alt="blogs.perl.org" /></p>

<p>I like the principle to have a dedicated place where you come to check Perl related posts… but unfortunately there seems to be long standing problems with <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> :confused:</p>

<p>People report technical problems :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problems with authentication and/or reset password</li>
  <li>Problems with posting comments</li>
  <li>Design outdated</li>
  <li>User experience when writing posts</li>
  <li>No easy upgrade path since it is based on an old derived/forked version of <a href="https://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Before I continue, I just wanted to say « thank you » to all volunteers that are running BPO. The imperfections do not remove their effort to bring this valuable platform to the Perl community :+1:</p>

<h2 id="bpo-revamping-trials">BPO revamping trials</h2>
<p>There were already TPF 2 grants :</p>
<ul>
  <li>2015 - <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_revitalize_blog">Revitalize blogs.perl.org</a> - Jeffrey Goff (RIP)</li>
  <li>2017 - <a href="https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/grant_proposal_revitalize_blog_1">Revitalize blogs.perl.org</a> - Andre Walker</li>
</ul>

<p>A “grant” is a mission paid by <a href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a></p>

<p>Both grants were trying to migrate to <a href="https://github.com/Perl-Evozon/PearlBee">PerlBee</a> that is a blog engine written in Perl.</p>

<h4 id="what-went-wrong--what-is-the-difficulty-">What went wrong ? What is the difficulty ?</h4>
<p>I don’t know exactly, but I believe without any doubt that there were several problems that make it not straightforward at all and make these grants fail.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-now-">What about now ?</h2>
<p>Despite these numerous problems, <strong>BPO</strong> is up and running, with reduced posting traffic (maybe 5 posts a week).</p>

<p>One of the former admin behind BPO seem <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl/">pushing</a> to make people migrate elsewhere but without making it read-only or cutting the power (so far). They obviously don’t want to invest any support in BPO since it is in a kind of “decommissioning” state.</p>

<p>Are bloggers happy or they tolerates the drawbacks ? I don’t know.</p>

<p><strong>I WAS</strong> a fervent supporter of keeping this “concept” running…</p>

<p>…until recently :persevere:</p>

<p>I was even about to drop a <a href="https://github.com/metacpan/prepan">new idea</a> on the table of possible replacements, but I finally refrained and time gave me the answer :smile:</p>

<p>I will elaborate below.</p>

<h2 id="mylife">#MyLife</h2>
<p>Concerning blogs, I’m more a reader than a writer, and if I call Perl bloggers to come on DevTo, it is because I’m eager to read <em>your</em> posts.</p>

<p>Anyway, recently I tried to write a bit more.</p>

<p>I found this schema on <a href="https://rakhim.org">rakhim.org</a> and I found it very true :)</p>

<p>(I circled where I’m standing)
<img src="/assets/images/yhzk2xbcsejivs4t2wbg.jpg" alt="Blogs" /></p>

<p>Yes, I wrote a static website generator (in Perl) that is so quick and dirty and not generic that I will never made it public :D</p>

<p>The main part looks like this :</p>

<p>And I also used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> and I still use it for instance when contributing to <a href="https://www.perl.com/">perl.com</a></p>

<p>I recently also set up a blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a></p>

<p>And of course I used a customized-custom theme from <a href="https://github.com/akiritsu/pRoJEct-VeXEd">Project VeXed</a></p>

<p>If I “customized” it, it was mainly to make it more <a href="https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/wawawa/pmtrx/">“Perlish”</a> :smile:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/9tjua0xvfifv91wfjw04.png" alt="My blog" />
(do not look for this blog, I killed it some days ago)</p>

<p>Finally I spent the whole paragraph about the setup of blogs  so I should get extra points :smile:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0uw7rx2236jyorrzkxi0.jpg" alt="Elaborate on blog setup" /></p>

<p>The #MyLife section stops here. The conclusion is that I experimented some solutions before to call people to join me here.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-recommend-devto">Why I recommend DevTo</h2>
<p>The user experience when writing is very good (to be honest, Medium and Wordpress are even better, but it is good enough).</p>

<p>Why not using medium then ? There is no <a href="https://medium.com/tag/perl">#perl tag</a> and I feel like Medium is less a <em>developer</em> hub than DevTo.</p>

<p>There are also already some traffic here (at least as much as BPO) and some brand names.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dev.to/t/perl">#perl tag</a> is already administrated (by <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab">Gabor Szabo</a> ! :))</p>

<p>The format is <strong>Markdown</strong> which is generally a good point (but not always, I can understand).</p>

<h2 id="the-ghetto">The ghetto</h2>
<p>BPO is a “Perl ghetto” which is both good and bad. Good because this is a what some readers are actually looking for, and bad because of non exposure to programming world.</p>

<p>When you think that the biggest flaw of Perl is its reputation… :worried:</p>

<p>DevTo greatly offers the best of both. Your blog posts are open to broad (technical) audience but the <a href="https://dev.to/t/perl">#perl tag</a> fully recreates the “ghetto” use case from an reader point of view (and it really works well).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m not the first one to promote DevTo actually, I’m joining the call from <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2020/11/perl-on-devto.html">Gabor Szabo</a>, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2020/09/crosspost-nginxcertbot-recipe.html">Joel Berger</a> and <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl/">Dave Cross</a> to ask you to build together the future of Perl blogging on DevTo !</p>

<p>Whatever you decide, “Happy Perl !” and please keep posting so I can continue to read you :smile:</p>

<p>(I was not paid by <a href="https://dev.to/">DevTo</a> :smile:)</p>
