<h1 id="speaker-announcement-clement-oudot">Speaker announcement: Clement Oudot</h1>
<p>When I tried to find speakers for <a href="https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/">the ephemeral miniconf</a>, I contacted (or “bothered” or “spammed”) some french people that I knew could give very interesting talks. And I’m very happy that it worked!</p>

<p><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/clementoudot">Clement Oudot</a> is a strong Open Source (or even “Open standard”) believer, and as such he is part of the board of <a href="https://cnll.fr/">CNLL</a> and <a href="https://www.ow2.org/">OW2</a>.</p>

<p>He is also an expert in LDAP and more in general directories, IAM, authentication etc…</p>

<h2 id="talk">Talk</h2>
<p>Clement will present <a href="https://lemonldap-ng.org/welcome/">LemonLDAP::NG</a> which you probably already know since it’s a major implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.</p>
