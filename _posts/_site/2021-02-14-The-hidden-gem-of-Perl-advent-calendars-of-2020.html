<p>We had advent calendars once again this year :smiley:

<p>There was the <a href="http://perladvent.org/2020/">Perl advent calendar 2020</a> that was special this year since it was a “best of”.</p>

<p>There was also the <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/">Raku advent calendar</a> where I even contributed an article about <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/2020/12/10/day-10-my-10-commandments-for-raku-performances/">performances, profiling and optimizations</a> :sunglasses:</p>

<p>And the <a href="https://advent.perldancer.org/2020">Twelve days of dancer</a> :dancer:</p>

<p>I think there was no <strong>Mojolicious</strong> advent calendar this year (?!).</p>

<p>Except if I forgot one (please comment!) this is the list of Perl related advent calendars… But STOP! There was an hidden gem that traversed december while being relatively unnoticed.</p>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/author/PEVANS">Paul “Leonerd” Evans</a> delivered a complete <a href="http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2020/12/2020-perl-advent-calendar-day-1.html">Perl advent calendar 2020</a> (alone! :astonished:)</p>

<p>To be honest, I discovered recently and haven’t had time to read it, but I wanted to share the link :grin:</p>

<p>The advent calendar discusses asynchronous control flow which is a very interesting but complex topic.</p>

<p>It’s the second time he produced an advent calendar alone (see his <a href="http://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2013/12/futures-advent-day-1.html">Perl advent calendar in 2013</a>).</p>

<p>I recognize the effort when it personally takes me a lot of time to write blog posts, maybe because I’m not an English native speaker, but also because it simply just takes a lot ot times to write blog posts.</p>

<p>This guy clearly deserves a medal.</p>

<p>Without mentioning that <a href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/paul-evans-writing-a-core-perl-feature-110e">he is writing a core Perl feature blog serie</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18537">he pushed de-experimentalising “signatures”</a> that was very well received.

<p>And on top of that, he’s a core Perl contributor.
