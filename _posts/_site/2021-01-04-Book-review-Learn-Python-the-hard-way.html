<p>When I ordered this book, I made a mistake, blinded by good reviews and cheap price :smiley:</p>

<p>My fault, because I wanted to refresh a bit my python skills but this book is for total beginner (non-programmer).</p>

<p>But finally, this is the kind of errors that does not hurt… Even the contrary, I quickly read this book and it was cool :)</p>

<h2 id="review-of-the-different-parts">Review of the different parts</h2>
<p>This book starts very slowly, not a surprise actually :smiley:</p>

<p>It is illustrated by cool examples (I mean code snippets).
Sometimes, notions are less smooth and a bit parachuted like <strong>modules</strong> and later <strong>setup.py</strong>, but I say this because I tried to put me in the shoes of a total beginner.</p>

<p>After some time, it goes into more real world examples like programming a small game or a mini web app.
The chapters about the game with objects is nice but contains big snippet and a lot of prints.</p>

<p>The overall was pleasant to read but I cheated and do not followed “the hard way” (typing all the snippets) :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:</p>

<h2 id="strong-opinion-about-programming">Strong opinion about programming…</h2>
<p>The author has strong opinions, mainly to try to “keep is simple” for the reader. Here are some :</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Inheritance is evil forest”</li>
  <li>“Multiple inheritance is evil queen”</li>
</ul>

<p>The author also recommends “Shot gun prints”, I don’t know what to say about it, it’s not totally true nor false.</p>

<h2 id="but-not-about-language">…but not about language</h2>
<p>He is preaching for making people learn a lot of languages :</p>
<ul>
  <li>“When learning a language, don’t be a stupid tourist”</li>
  <li>“Don’t be religious with a language”</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not sure about his definition of knowing a language since he consider being able to learn a new language in 1 day to 1 week.</p>

<h2 id="critical-about-programmer-job">Critical about programmer job</h2>
<p>Along the book (and even more in the “advice from an old programmer” section), the author is very critic about programmer job, and I find it very interesting.</p>

<p>For instance, it is said:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Become programmer, only if you can’t imagine doing something else”</li>
  <li>“Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting.”</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also recommended to apply IT science to something real like physics, medicine or industry and not only “IT for IT”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I will conclude with this citation “Programming is the only form of art that allows you to create interactive art” and by saying that it is a nice book :+1:</p>
