<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Once upon a time, 
a guy named Larry Wall 
created a language called Perl.

He became the BDFL 
of this PL 
which values are TIMTOWTDI, 
DWIM, 
POLA 
and as all UNIXes: 
KISS 
and DOTADIW.

Perl enhances some key concepts 
of AWK, 
SED 
or GREP 
and even provides ACK 
and leads industry standard REGEX 
(PCRE).

PPL started to ‚ù§Ô∏è Perl, 
meeting in PM groups 
and calling themself JAPH.

Eventually, big-sized meetings appeared 
like YAPC, 
TPC 
and TPRCIC 
(or chartreuse-sized ones like PTS).

There were also associations 
like TPF 
or EPO 
and individuals 
like YOU 
and ME.

FYI in 2021, 
I decided to organize TEM 
because hey, YOLO!

Technically speaking, 
you can say Perl 
or perl 
but not PERL 
nor the horrific PEARL... üò±

And if you don't know, 
go on IRC 
and ask PURL! ü§ñ 

People say 
"Only perl can parse Perl" 
but there is PPI, 
PPR 
and PLS.

Interfacing w/ native extensions is easy 
with FFI, 
XS, 
SWIG 
or WASM 
(and even easier with NCI in Raku).

Perl lovers contribute 
to the CPAN w/ ‚ù§Ô∏è  
via PAUSE 
so Perl users can use CPANP, 
CPANM 
or CPM 
to DRY.

You can browse MetaCPAN 
for DBI, 
EUMM, 
MB, 
LWP 
or PDL 
or even some idiot ACME.

Each DIST 
contains a whole lot of DOC 
in a format named POD 
and even a dedicated RT Q.

If you're in trouble, 
have a look at HOP 
or PBP.

IMHO 
it is a good PPT, 
but maybe a bit WTF... 
IDK ü§∑
THX for attending 
and FWIW 
here is a well deserved GIF.

TY
