<h1 id="regex">Regex</h1>
<p><strong>“Regex”</strong> is the small name of <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?RegularExpression">Regular expressions</a></p>

<p><strong>Regex</strong> are one of the superpowers :muscle: of <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>
<img src="/assets/images/tioynjfepr3j7qzxdixr.png" alt="Perl &lt;3 Regex" /></p>

<p>It’s a <em>productivity</em> superpower the same way knowing command line shortcuts and mastering vim.</p>

<p><strong>Regex</strong> could become one of <em>your</em> programmer superpowers also if you decide to.

<p>But “regex” have also a <em>nefarious reputation</em> because they are hard, error-prone and misused.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway">Damian Conway</a> is a master of regular expressions but you can sometimes feel the pain in his mouth when he discusses regex

<p>Or even
<img src="/assets/images/r4kxkfi0pxcx0scc2g73.png" alt="Misery" /></p>

<p>But on a more positive note, Damian said

<p>It could be strange to advocate a <em>wrong thing</em> but sometimes you just don’t need more than a one shot program, and for me it would be dumb (or irresponsible) to spend more time than needed just <strong>“for the sake of correctness”</strong>.

<p>I know it’s not really the hype of these days where over engineering is better perceived than KISS principles (I exaggerate just a little) but it is pragmatism.</p>

<h1 id="regex-are-bad">Regex are bad</h1>
<p>Regex are bad, everybody knows, and here is the very famous <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">SO answer “You can’t parse [X]HTML with regex”</a> about that :grinning: 
<img src="/assets/images/fghx6z9n1duiha62sfnz.jpg" alt="Idiot" /></p>

<h1 id="are-they-really">Are they really?</h1>
<p>Some people have played the “devil’s advocate” and came with regex for XML like this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4234491">great answer from Tom Christiansen</a> where he used regex to tokenize then Perl to parse.</p>

<p>But even <strong>Tom Christiansen</strong> said 
<img src="/assets/images/3gztnahxug1iev81axau.png" alt="Should" /></p>

<p>Seems also like <strong>PCRE</strong> are <em>more</em> than simple regular grammars but actually I can’t say if mathematically <strong>Perl regex</strong> can or can’t parse XML, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Patterns_for_non-regular_languages">regular expression page on wikipedia</a> says that 
<img src="/assets/images/2qef7xde37bme6twmawb.png" alt="Regular not regular" /></p>

<p>Another interesting old link on this topic is <a href="https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/REX.html">REX</a>. The abstract of it is</p>

<p><strong><em>The syntax of XML is simple enough that it is possible to parse an XML document into a list of its markup and text items using a single regular expression. Such a shallow parse of an XML document can be very useful for the construction of a variety of lightweight XML processing tools</em></strong></p>

<p>(I do not quoted this one on a picture since I’m too afraid to awake Cthulhu)</p>

<h1 id="then-what-are-regex-recommended-for">Then what are regex <em>recommended</em> for</h1>
<p>While use of complex regex are subject to discussions, there are perfect and obvious use cases for regex:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Validation of input</li>
  <li>Cleaning of input</li>
  <li>Restructuring of input</li>
  <li>Looking for substrings within input</li>
</ul>

<p>I discussed about <strong><em>WrongButGoodEnough</em></strong> regex that help you save the world on a Friday evening:
<img src="/assets/images/kogecvqvo2s12dtohfbw.png" alt="Save" /></p>

<p>But writing regex is hard to master and you probably don’t
<img src="/assets/images/158rcsp35vv6mjmeua2i.jpg" alt="Trial" /></p>

<p>One solution is to leave your cat typing the regex for you!

<h1 id="perl-folks-are-crazy-about-regex">Perl folks are crazy about regex</h1>
<p>I wanted to finish with this crazy fact, fasten your seat belts.</p>

<p>Perl folks are really serious about regex
<img src="/assets/images/z48um17vo69q3k5bvdaj.png" alt="Serious" /></p>

<p>This is mad.</p>
