<p>I like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, it provides a nice little and simple free hosting. I also like their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site generators</a> (SSG) companions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> - used by example for <a href="https://perl.com">perl.com</a> (<a href="https://github.com/perladvent/perldotcom">source</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> - that I used for <a href="https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/">The ephemeral miniconf</a> (<a href="https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf">source</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>About 3 years ago, I spent some time experimenting with more advanced Hugo and Jekyll concepts (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/">variables</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">config</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/">layouts</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">includes</a>, …).</p>

<p>I wanted to produce a modular website with content separated from a complex structure, using parameterized includes.</p>

<p>The experiment also contained a commenting system powered by GitHub issues (yes!) along with a blog (it’s Jekyll after all!). 
I used this effort to compare Hugo and Jekyll features (Jekyll won for me). 
Then I continued by adding some content, syntax highlighting and various other things…</p>

<p>But why I tagged this post with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#perl</code> tag?</p>

<p>Because ultimately the website content is about Perl, with some generic informations and links that I tried to present in a bit “catchy” way.</p>

<p>After some time, I let this website aging somewhere in my GitHub private space.</p>

<p>Nobody asked for it, but this is finally it!</p>

<h1 id="fish-perlfish-tropical_fish">:fish: <a href="https://perl.fish/">perl.fish</a> :tropical_fish:</h1>

<p>It’s public but I have zero plan for this.</p>

<p>And about the name “perl-dot-fish”, I doubt I can give any explanation except that I consider that “it sounds good”.</p>

<h1 id="a-little-preview">A little preview</h1>

<p>For the very most lazy :grinning:, here is a little preview:

<p>It’s also looking good on mobile.</p>

<p>Note: for the design skeleton, I started from <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a> (license permits it), but it now has well diverged.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registry: <a href="https://www.identity.digital/">Identity Digital</a> for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.fish</code> (I wanted to pick a not so common nTLD)</li>
  <li>Registrar: <a href="https://www.ovhcloud.com">OVH</a></li>
  <li>DNS: <a href="https://www.ovhcloud.com">OVH</a></li>
  <li>Hosting: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
  <li>Framework: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (SSG)</li>
</ul>

<p>I built using Jekyll <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">parameterized includes</a>, to me it makes it both modular and a bit inelegant :grinning: 
Website is easy to edit and the GitHub Pages setup <a href="https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/perlfish/actions">deploys on commit</a>.</p>

<p>Read the source at <a href="https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle/perlfish">perlfish</a></p>

<p>It’s and experiment, probably running for about a year.</p>
