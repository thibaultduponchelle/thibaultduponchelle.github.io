<p>When I read <strong>Sparrow</strong> I think about:

<p>Or:
<img src="/assets/images/a10qil1g6r9wpy1y4u7z.jpeg" alt="Pirate dog" /></p>

<p>Or even :grin::
<img src="/assets/images/vnnhqr61fv462bagrfxy.jpeg" alt="Pirate dog" /></p>

<p>But I’m pretty sure that <a href="https://github.com/melezhik">his author</a> sees this:
<img src="/assets/images/btwr1970ogcitpon32zl.jpeg" alt="Sparrow" />
(because it is actually what means “sparrow”)</p>

<p>Alternatively, I think about the well known contemporary pirate:

<p>But to be honest, my favorite stays the <strong>pirate dog</strong> !</p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-sparrow-">What exactly is Sparrow ?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6">Sparrow</a> is an automation framework. And to be more specific, it is “agentless” and comes with a <a href="https://sparrowhub.io">hub</a> with hundreds of ready to use tasks.</p>

<p>Tasks can be written in various programming languages because of the flexibility of <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6">Sparrow</a>.</p>

<p>If we talk about scenario file (the “recipe”, think playbook/Jenkinsfile/workflow), <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6">Sparrow</a> accepts an handy DSL but has aswell real programming capabilities (= you can mix code).</p>

<p>Overall, think <em>“ansible”</em> but without yaml (bye bye <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loop</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with_&lt;lookup&gt;</code>).</p>

<h2 id="what-next-">What next ?</h2>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6">Sparrow</a> ecosystem is mature enough (<a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparrow6">Sparrow</a> and <a href="https://sparrowhub.io/">Sparrowhub</a>) but is still in active development, including <a href="https://github.com/melezhik/sparky">Sparky</a>, a lightweight CI server/UI built on top of it that is in early development.</p>

<p>If you want to support, you can join the effort with code or simply just drop a star or a comment on one of projects linked previously.</p>
