<p>Have you heard about <strong>The Ephemeral Miniconf</strong> ?</p>

<p>It’s a Perl/Raku free and online miniconf that will take place on <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/meetings/">Zoom</a>!</p>

<p>Think “TPRCiC” but way smaller/shorter and with only one track :)</p>

<p>Single day, single track, Perl, Raku and fun.</p>

<p>I’m honored to have some experienced speakers about Perl, GitHub, Devops, LDAP etc… You will enjoy I promise!</p>

<p>More informations on <a href="https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/">the website</a>.</p>

<p>I can give you already the <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/meetings/">Zoom</a> connections informations:</p>

<p>It’s planned at 3pm UTC+1 (Paris time) so check <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/ec3d1b5c">the timezone planner</a> to know when it is for you.</p>

<p>It’s in the morning if you’re in US, in the afternoon if you’re in Europe and very late if you’re in Asia or Australia (sorry).</p>

<p>The planning will be something like this:

<p>(it could last longer or change a bit inside the range, like shifting talks, but at the moment here it is)</p>

<p>I’m also possibly preparing some surprises that I don’t want to reveal for now.</p>

<p>So my message is basically, it’s coming, book your calendar and I’m looking forward to see you at <strong>The Ephemeral Miniconf</strong>!</p>
