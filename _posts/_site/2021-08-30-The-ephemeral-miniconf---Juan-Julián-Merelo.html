<p><a href="https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/"><strong>The ephemeral miniconf</strong></a> is a Perl and Raku miniconf or maybe it’s a Raku and Perl miniconf :grinning:</p>

<p>It’s with great pleasure that I present today one of the first speaker that joined the miniconf :relaxed:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JJ"><strong>Juan Julián Merelo</strong></a> is a very experienced Perl and Raku developer, a professor, a researcher and most of all a major <em>community pilar</em>.</p>

<p>I wanted to insist on this point since Juan Julián Merelo gave several talks and even recently managed the organization of the Raku (and Perl) room at FOSDEM 2021.</p>

<p>He also recently published a couple of books on Raku! :heart:</p>

<p>Juan Julián Merelo from his own bio:

He has used it continously at his day job as professor at the University of Granada, contributed to CPAN since 2001 and participated in two YAPC conferences talking about evolutionary algorithms in Perl and organised YAPC 2015. He’s known to engage people who say that other languages are better than Perl, specially those who, besides, think that vim is better than emacs. Recently published a book about Perl 6.”</p>

<p>emacs is better than vim :hushed:</p>
