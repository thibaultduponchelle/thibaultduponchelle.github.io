<p><strong><em>The Perl programmers were a clan-based cultural group that was composed of members from multiple species all bound by a common culture, creed, and code. They originated on the planet Unix in the Outer Rim Territories and had a particularly important role in Internet history as legendary hackers/gurus.</em></strong></p>
