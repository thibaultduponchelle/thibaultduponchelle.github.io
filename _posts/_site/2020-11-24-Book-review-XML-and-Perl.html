<p>I continue my reviews with another antic Perl book :smile:</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>A lot of weaknesses of this book are due to the age but I won’t refrain to report them with honesty :)</p>

<p>I’m very grateful to the person that took time to write this book : <strong>Mark Riehl</strong> and <strong>Ilya Sterin</strong> !</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>It is outdated, definitely, like a bit frozen in 2003.</p>

<p>I wrote another book review about <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/book-review-perl-and-lwp-emd">Perl and LWP</a> which was outdated also but not suffering as much as this book.</p>

<p>Clearly, this book was written during the “XML boom” in 2003 and keeps scars from this period :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The coding style is not modern</li>
  <li>When you want to make people able to be quickly efficient with Perl and XML (probably the idea of the authors), you give a lot of “ready to use” code snippets (and it ages bad)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/46y6wo9j31kxk6rlc6k7.jpg" alt="Outdated" /></p>

<p>When I looked for some technologies in Google, I was suprised (but interested) to see they were just dead :grin: :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Axkit</li>
  <li>XQL</li>
</ul>

<p>There is only one edition of this book therefore it explains why it is so outdated.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>I liked the way it goes deep in the XML things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xslt</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XML schema</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xlink</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xpointer</code>.</p>

<p>I really appreciated to explanations about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Web Services</code> (very clear, <strong>best explanation I read about this topic so far !</strong>) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SOAP</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XML-RPC</code>.</p>

<p>In the same topic, the comparison <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SOAP</code> vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CORBA</code> vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RMI</code> vs … is very nicely detailed.</p>

<p>In the part about XML in general, I found some very interesting parts :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Listing and details about elements</li>
  <li>When to use attributes or elements (this endless question has a simple answer…)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DTD</code> vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XML Schema</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And finally the paragraphs about <strong>tying XML to RDBMS</strong> are very interesting.</p>

<p>What is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Schematron</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WML</code> ? :grin:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To really enjoy this book, you need to know Perl but you should not know too much XML (which was not my case, I already studied the XML spec in the past to write an <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Minifier">XML minifier</a>)</p>

<p>There are <strong>TOO MUCH</strong> code samples, each time the XML sample + the DTD + Perl code to process it = TOO MUCH :smiley:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pisxf7au1yqugwo2w448.jpg" alt="Too much" /></p>

<p>No human can read so much code samples without falling asleep :sleeping:</p>

<p>But overall there’s still a lot of history bits and various notions around XML and the book really deserves to be skimmed.</p>
