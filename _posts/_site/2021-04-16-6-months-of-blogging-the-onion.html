<p>It has been around 6 months since I started to blog <strong>a lot</strong>.</p>

<p>I followed the calls from <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2020/11/perl-on-devto.html">Gabor Szabo</a>, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2020/09/crosspost-nginxcertbot-recipe.html">Joel Berger</a> and <a href="https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl/">Dave Cross</a> then on top I added <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/a-call-to-perl-bloggers-to-come-on-dev-to-27ee">mine</a></p>

<p>My intention was clearly to setup a “Perl blogging scene” on devto and I feel like it works, see <a href="https://dev.to/t/perl">#Perl</a> and numbers from <a href="https://perlweekly.com/stats.html">perlweekly</a>:
<img src="/assets/images/3qxe3goonfapyvd1folp.png" alt="Blogs" /></p>

<p>The number of blog posts does not decreased on BPO (it was not the goal, I want <em>more</em> posts, not less!) but the number of posts on <a href="https://dev.to/">DevTo</a> increased lot yeah ! :dancer:
It reached a minimum steady number that make it a viable place to monitor for posts :) (and to make people join and contribute)</p>

<p>It’s a teamwork and I do not deserve much credits, but I did a pretty decent effort (more than 50 blog posts in 6 months):
<img src="/assets/images/t4bwduxct8dxq1u2simz.png" alt="A lot of posts" /></p>

<p>Will I blog as much for the coming 6 months? Probably not, but I have to say that blogging is very rewarding since I have the feeling to show Perl in a nice way and I have a lot of interactions with great people (comments :heart:).</p>

<p>It also helps me practice the “art of writing”, help me to dig deeper in some areas and suddenly there are so much great blog posts from Perl figures all around!
@mjgardner @leontimmermans @kraih @davorg @ovid @haarg  @tobyink
(I wanted to put more names but there is a limit on how many people I can mention)</p>

<p>These people are often more successful than me (I have to admit that they produce better blog posts :smiley:), <strong>Ovid</strong> had an immediate huge success with Perl-but-generalist posts, that’s crazy!</p>

<h1 id="hits">Hits</h1>
<p>Back to me, my biggest hit is not Perl related but about <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-github-action-mining-attack-through-pull-request-2lmc">how a user triggered a crypto miner in my github action through a malicious pull request</a>, if you’re interested in github actions and security, check it out.</p>

<p>My other hits (could we really talk about <em>hits</em>? :grinning:) are around the topic of Perl and blogging: <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/a-call-to-perl-bloggers-to-come-on-dev-to-27ee">A call to Perl bloggers to come on DevTo</a> or <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/to-help-perl-just-blog-9h4">To help Perl, just blog</a></p>

<p>Or around Perl reputation like <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/a-perl-love-letter-20jj">A Perl love letter</a> or <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-hate-of-perl-in-memes-469e">The hate of Perl in memes</a></p>

<p>I also made books reviews that I wrote also as a kind of “personal notes”. The list of reviews is <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/about-perl-books-review-1cj6">here</a></p>

<p><a href="https://dev.to/t/mojolicious">Mojolicious related</a> posts are always well received! Like for instance this <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/simple-live-chart-using-mojolicious-1iej">Simple live chart using mojolicious</a></p>

<p>In between I wrote a lot of posts about toolchain/(Meta)CPAN:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/a-tour-of-perl-github-actions-44lp">A tour of perl github actions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/browse-cpan-modules-per-namespaces-6p">Browse CPAN modules per namespace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/new-upload-to-cpan-github-action-4h8j">My GitHub action to upload to CPAN</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/cpan-utils-4g4p">CPAN utils</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/adoptaperlmodule-2oh2">#AdoptAPerlModule</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/svg-cpan-logo-gel">SVG CPAN logo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/install-cpan-modules-from-different-sources-with-cpanminus-5afi">Install CPAN modules from different sources</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And do you read my <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-tprcic-2020-review-1187">first post</a>?</p>

<h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
<p>To be honest there are also some failures that I consider even more interesting to link :smiley:</p>

<p>My parallel between <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/perl-programmers-are-mandalorians-l0b">Perl devs and Mandalorians</a> was cool but a bit weird for readers :smiley: (but I get some very kind likes)</p>

<p>I am proud of my serie about JAPHs (what a “risky” topic) but the 2 first episodes <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/japhs-autopsies-1-4939">JAPHs autopsies 1</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/japhs-autopsies-2-41jl">JAPHs autopsies 2</a> were almost totally ignored.</p>

<p>My posts in French never worked but I continued to post them anyway :grinning: like <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/book-review-perl-pour-l-impatient-4dfi">Book review “Perl pour l’impatient”</a> or this terrible absolutely-no-like <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/critique-de-livre-gimp-2-10-special-debutants-4gio">Critique de livre : Gimp 2.10 - Special debutants</a></p>

<p>Aside from Perl, I published some posts about docker (<a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/do-you-really-need-to-merge-docker-layers-1j1">1</a>, <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/remotely-connect-to-a-running-docker-12id">2</a>) or security (<a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/billion-laughs-attack-examples-59i">Billions laughs attack</a>)</p>

<p>(I’m kidding with “failures” but it is not, I’m not writing for likes)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I said <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/a-call-to-perl-bloggers-to-come-on-dev-to-27ee">in my call</a>, I’m more a blog reader than a writer, so I’m very eager to read <em>your</em> posts!</p>

<p>So please dear reader, unleash the writer living in you! :smiley:</p>
