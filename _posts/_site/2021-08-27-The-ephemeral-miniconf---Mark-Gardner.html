<p>I first followed with appetite his talk/posts about signatures then I enjoyed, as many of you (inside and outside Perl community), his regular (re)posts on <a href="https://dev.to/mjgardner">his devto</a> (but his main blog is on <a href="https://phoenixtrap.com/">phoenixtrap</a>)</p>

<p>It sounded like an evidence that he would be a good candidate to talk at <a href="https://thibaultduponchelle.github.io/the-ephemeral-miniconf/">the ephemeral miniconf</a>!</p>

<h2 id="mark-is-what-we-really-call-a-senior-developer">Mark is what we really call a senior developer</h2>
<p>His own biography says: 
<em>“Hi, I’m Mark Gardner, […] I help professional Perl developers to engineer modern, disciplined applications in the cloud so they can become experts that write easy-to-maintain code with confidence, increase their relevance in the market and get the best positions, high salaries, and work on interesting projects.”</em></p>

Mark is a long time programmer and Perl developer that gave much more attention to my eyes recently.</p>

<p>I can add my own on top of this, I like the way he work deep (with alternatives, with implications etc…) the topics he addresses (see his work on signatures) and with several links!</p>

<h2 id="the-favorite-blogger-of-your-favorite-blogger">The favorite blogger of your favorite blogger</h2>
<p>We are lucky to have some great Perl bloggers and Mark is one of the leaders!</p>

<p>He is currently running a serie of blog posts that are even sometimes hitting the top “outside Perl bubble” to reuse a formula from him.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>See you soon for next announcement!</p>

<p><strong>Kind reminder</strong>: Call for papers still open but only 1 or 2 normal slot(s) remaining! See <a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-ephemeral-miniconf-292j">The ephemeral miniconf announcement/CFP</a> for details.</p>
