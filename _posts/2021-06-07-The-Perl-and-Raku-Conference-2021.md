## General
It's once again this time of the year! :smile: 

[The Perl and Raku Conference (in the Cloud)](https://perlconference.us/tprc-2021-cloud/) is back!

It's happening tomorrow and you will be able to follow the talks on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/yapcna) but if you really want to join the fest, you have to pay [a small fee of 10$](https://tprc2021cic.sched.com/tickets?iframe=no) to receive the precious password to join the conference (I recommend to to this).

You will then be able to join thanks to [zoom](https://zoom.us/download)

## Last year
Last year I enjoyed a lot the conference and wrote [this review](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/my-tprcic-2020-review-1187), read it if you haven't already :grinning:

For the record, last year was announced **Perl 7** :tada:

## My talks
This year, I took a step to become a speaker :sunglasses:
 
I prepared 2 talks, first one will be a lightning talk that I called [**"My big year of GitHub actions"**](https://tprc2021cic.sched.com/event/jM3n/lightning-talks-day-1?iframe=no): I made so much GitHub workflows this year that I know a bit the limits (I used and abused a bit from this service). I came to know even some corner cases (or was pushed a little bit into them). I will tell you them, chronologically.

My second talk is called [**"Answering questions about CPAN that nobody asked"**](https://tprc2021cic.sched.com/event/jqLE/answering-questions-about-cpan-that-nobody-asked?iframe=no) and is about experiments around package managers, CPAN/PAUSE, EUMM/MB, dependencies and versioning. I will guide you through my tests and I assure it will be entertaining and lightweight :+1:
This one is longer and will also discuss a bit "general engineering practices" (applied to Perl ecosystem).

See you there (maybe?) :smiley:
