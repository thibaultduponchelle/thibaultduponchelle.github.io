***The Perl programmers were a clan-based cultural group that was composed of members from multiple species all bound by a common culture, creed, and code. They originated on the planet Unix in the Outer Rim Territories and had a particularly important role in Internet history as legendary hackers/gurus.***

Experienced Perl programmers are powerful and respected, but sometimes suffer from being rejected by other cultures that do not embrace Perl qualities.

***Perl masters were some of the most feared warriors in the galaxy.***

They are now spread all over the universe, sometimes exiled. They often prefer to stay discrete.

***- sharing - portability - stability -***

When people meet a Perl programmer, they have a strange reaction then look at him and say "so you're one of them?"
