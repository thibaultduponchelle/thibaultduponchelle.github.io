## Background
I'm sometimes doing Front End dev.

Or sometimes the best tool for the job is only installable via `npm`. 

It can be scripts to "uglify" or "beautify" css/js, optimize svg files (`svgo`) or clients to SaaS platforms (`wrangler`).

Actually, it's not that important if it's part of javascript ecosystem, what I want is just to execute them!

The usual process: I start testing it locally, quickly and in a "trash-able" way, then install in a continuous integration pipeline, then forget :smile:

So far, do you feel some resemblance with some periodical process or yours? 

For this purpose, I'm using frequently [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) (now part of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)).

Do you see now where I'm going to? :thinking:

## App::cpx, a `npx`-like for CPAN

I just uploaded [App::cpx](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpx) for this purpose.

Give `cpx` a binary and it will find it in CPAN, install it for you then execute it.

```
$ cpx hr -s 40
ðŸŽ¯ Found [bin/hr]
ðŸ“¦ Release to install [https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/W/WO/WOLDRICH/App-term-hr-0.11.tar.gz]
ðŸ”§ Will install into /home/tib/cpx-test/.cpx
DONE install Term-ExtendedColor-0.504
DONE install App-term-hr-0.11
2 distributions installed.
=======================================
```
(purpose of `hr` is to draw horizontal lines)

Or another example with `mlocate`:
```
$  cpx mlocate Redis Moo
ðŸŽ¯ Found [bin/mlocate]
ðŸ“¦ Release to install [https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/C/CE/CELOGEEK/App-Module-Locate-0.7.tar.gz]
ðŸ”§ Will install into /home/tib/cpx-test/.cpx
DONE install Module-Locate-1.80
DONE install Module-Build-0.4234
DONE install App-Module-Locate-0.7
3 distributions installed.
/usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/Redis.pm
/usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/Moo.pm
```

`mlocate` is a script that lives in [App::Module::Locate](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Module::Locate). It's an utility to "find a module by its name".

`cpx` saves you from some frustrating tries: 
- Is it `cpm install App::mlocate`? 
- OK try capitalize `cpm install App::Mlocate`, I know some authors do that
- Hmm maybe simply `locate` like this `cpm install App::locate`
- Oh wait, capitalize `cpm install App::Locate`
- Raaah! Stop it and open [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/) and search
- OK it's `cpm install App::Module::Locate` but now it's installed locally, how do I set local::lib? Maybe I should install globally
- Hmm I will install globally even if it can be a bit dirty for a one time use

And at start were you 100% sure `mlocate` was something that exists in CPAN? :thinking:

`cpx` saves you from this pain and hides you the internals of installing the module, if missing.

When running `cpx` again, it won't reinstall but reuse the already installed binary:
```
$ cpx mlocate Redis Moo
âš“ Found executable already installed
/usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/Redis.pm
/usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/Moo.pm
```

## Your companion for Continuous Integration 
```
$ curl -sL https://git.io/cpm | sudo perl - install -g App::cpx
$ cpx hr -s 40
```

In GitHub Actions, it would give something like this:
```yml
name : Test cpx
on: push
jobs:
  cpx:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Install cpx
        run: curl -sL https://git.io/cpm | sudo perl - install -g App::cpx
      - name: cpx hr 
        run: cpx hr -s 40
```

And see the result:

## Conclusion
As of now, the code for this small utility is *ridiculously* simple ([source](https://metacpan.org/release/CONTRA/App-cpx-0.03/source/bin/cpx)), but sometimes good ideas (yes, all glory to myself :grinning:) are simple to implement.
