## Tooling
You can use following tools to manipulate and produce other sizes and variants:
- [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for editing SVG
- [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to optimize SVG (`npm i svgo` then `./node_modules/.bin/svgo --pretty *.svg`)
- [rsvg](https://github.com/ropensci/rsvg) to resize SVG (`rsvg-convert -a -w 300 -f svg 097.svg > 097-300.svg`)
