Somewhere in the past I wrote [The hate of Perl in Memes](https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-hate-of-perl-in-memes-469e) and it's cool even if it's almost exclusively composed of *negative* memes (hence the post title :smiley:)

It's time to revenge :grinning:

## Unleash the power
Learning Perl is a rewarding journey:

Or change your mind:

Let yourself be guided:

## Resist!
General purpose language:

Get the job done:

Simply powerful:

Or even:

## Glue
Perl people help everyone:
