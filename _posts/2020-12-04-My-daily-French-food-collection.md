I often take pictures of some cooking from me, my wife, my mother, my stepmother or friends. 

My wife is kidding me often about this... :smiley:

"What you gonna do with this ?" "You're doing a collection ?" or even "Look at him he's taking picture or your cake ! LOL"

But these pictures also reflect nice "instant" enjoyed with people I love. 

And also some pictures are also very nice by themself :+1:
