### Yesterday’s baguette dilemma

In my wife’s family, we have a recurrent problem.

When I go visit my mother in law with my wife, we often buy a “baguette” on the way.

Later, at time to slice the bread, things go wrong: My mother in law generally have a remainder of bread from the previous day: it is the “Yesterday’s half baguette”.

While we usually would want to eat bread in the order we bought it [1], it’s also annoying to eat some _less_ fresh bread when we have a delicious “baguette from the day” at disposal [2][3].

So we are torn between:

-   Eat first yesterday’s _not fresh_ half baguette then continue with half of today _fresh_ bread. 50% not fresh bread, 50% fresh bread and leave a new remainder of (soon-to-be) not fresh bread for tomorrow :/
-   Eat first (and only) today’s _fresh_ bread.  
    100% fresh bread, but leaving now a (soon-to-be) 2 days half baguette for tomorrow :/

| Important decision    | Freshness | Wasteness |
| --- |    ---    |    ---    |
| Eat yesterday's baguette first     |  50% | 50% |
| Eat today's baguette first    |  100% | 100% |


None of these choices fixes our problem on both freshness and wasteness.

And the problem repeats forever.

This is the **Yesterday’s baguette dilemma**.
